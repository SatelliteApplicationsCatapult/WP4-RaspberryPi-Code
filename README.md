# WP4-RaspberryPi-Code
These programs were used  for the WP4 project. They have been implemented on a RaspberryPi 4 b. <br> The Raspberry Pi had two motors, a distance sensor adafruit vl6180x, and a RaspberryPi camera connected to it. <br>

# Gui.py
This code is a GUI interface to control both motors and the adafruit ditance sensor.
You will need a screen to use it. Connect it directly to the raspberry pi or connect remotely to the raspberry pi to visualise the GUI.
Make sure the motors are connected to the right ports defined in the code.
